                        Several major websites briefly went down Thursday in a widespread outage 
                        linked to content distribution network Akamai. By about 12:50 p.m. ET, 
                        Akamai said it fixed the issue and the service seemed to be back to normal. 
                        The company later said on Twitter that the issue was caused by a software 
                        update that triggered a bug. It confirmed the incident was not a result of 
                        a cyber attack on its platform. Akamai said the disruption lasted for “up 
                        to an hour” and apologized for the inconvenience.Akamai, whose operation 
                        helps data move around the internet, said on its website earlier Thursday 
                        that it was investigating “an emerging issue with the Edge DNS service.”Oracle 
                        had also pointed to Akamai as the source of the issue, which impacted some 
                        Oracle cloud properties, but it said resources within its own cloud service 
                        were not affected.The Domain Name System is like a phone book for websites. 
                        The technology figures out the right IP addresses to use when people try to 
                        go to individual websites. The Edge DNS service from Akamai takes care of 
                        this work for apps and websites and protects against distributed denial-of 
                        service, or DDoS, attacks.Delta Air Lines, British Airways, Capital One, 
                        Go Daddy, Vanguard, UPS, LastPass, AT&amp;T and Costco were among the 
                        websites loading slowly or showing “DNS failure” Thursday afternoon.The 
                        outage caused some real-world disruptions. For example, Delta customers 
                        could not use the airline’s website or app to check into flights until 
                        Akamai fixed the problem.
